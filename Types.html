        <h2>There are four types of Electric Vehicles:</h2>
        <ul type="square"><li style="color:blue;"><h3>Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)</h3></li>
            <p style="color: crimson;">A Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), sometimes known as an All-Electric Vehicle (AEV), is a vehicle that is driven by a battery and an electric drive train. These EVs do not have an IC Engine.</p>
            <p style="color: darkgreen;"><u>Main Components of BEV</u>: Battery, Control Module, Drive train, Electric motor, Inverter</p>
            <li style="color:blueviolet"><h3>Hybrid Electric vehicle (HEV)</h3></li>
            <p style="color: crimson;">The HEVs are operated by both an  IC Engine and an electric motor.In these sorts of electric vehicles, the internal combustion engine is powered by fuel (gasoline and other forms of fuel), while the motor is powered by batteries.The gasoline engine and electric motor rotate the gearbox, which drives the wheels, at the same time.</p>
            <p style="color: darkgreen;"><u>Main Components of HEV</u>: Battery pack with controller & inverter, Control module, Engine, Electric motor, Fuel tank</p>
            <li style="color:brown"><h3>Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)</h3></li>
            <p style="color: crimson;">A PHEV is a hybrid vehicle that has both an ICE and a motor, often known as a series hybrid.This sort of electric automobile comes with a variety of fuel options. This type of electric vehicle is propelled by a conventional fuel (such as gasoline) or an alternative fuel (such as biodiesel), as well as a rechargeable battery pack.</p>
            <p style="color: darkgreen;"><u>Main Components of PHEV</u>: Battery, Battery Charger (if onboard model), Control module, Electric motor, Engine, Fuel tank, Inverter</p>
            <li style="color:deepskyblue"><h3>Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV)</h3></li>
            <p style="color: crimson;">Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs), also known as fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) or Zero Emission Vehicles, are electric vehicles that use “Fuel Cell Technology” to create the electricity needed to power the vehicle.</p>
            <p style="color: darkgreen;"><u>Main Components of FCEV</u>: SBattery with converter and controller, Hydrogen storage tank, Electric motor, Fuel-cell stack</p></ul>
