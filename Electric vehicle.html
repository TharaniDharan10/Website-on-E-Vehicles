        <h3 style="color: brown;"> A <b>Electric vehicle (EV)</b> is defined as a vehicle that can be powered by an electric motor that draws electricity from a battery and is capable of being charged from an external source. </h3>
        <h3 style="color: chocolate;"> Electric cars work on the principle of transforming electric energy into mechanical energy, which is then used to obtain kinetic energy and enable motion in a vehicle. EVs feature an electric motor instead of a conventional fuel engine. Thus, electric energy replaces conventional fuel (petrol/diesel)</h3>
        <h2 style="color: blueviolet;">How does an Electric Vehicle work?</h2>
        <h3><u>When the carâ€™s pedal is pressed, the following occurs;</u>

            <ul type="circle" style="color: deeppink;"><li>The controller collects and manages electricity from batteries and inverters.</li>
            <li>When the controller is activated, the inverter transmits a certain quantity of electrical energy to the motor (according to the depth pressure on the pedal)</li>
            <li>Electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy by an electric motor (rotation)</li>
            <li>The rotation of the motor rotor turns the gearbox, causing the wheels to revolve and the automobile to move.</li></ul></h3>
